# About this project

In this projoct I will be showcasing the transformation of Horiseon's marketing website to meet accessibility standards and enhance search engine visibility.

# What I did in this project?

In this project I added a title "Horiseon Social Solution Services - Social Media Marketing Agency" using the relevant element which was "h1" within the header section. This allow the page to have a welcoming title.

I relpaced div elements with semantic elements such as "header" "nav" "section" "article" and "footer" this allowed clear structure to be provided. These elements allows it to be easier for screen reader to understand the contnet on the page.

I also added small comments to add a clear explination for readers on the page.
